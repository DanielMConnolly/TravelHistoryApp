# TravelHistoryApp
This app records a users location every half hour in the background. It then displays all the locations to which the user has travelled using
a Google Maps API.

I used Google Maps API in the map. I stored the locations locally in a SQLLite database. I used a service to record the locations in the background, so that the user wouldn't have to be concerned with manually recording his or her location.
